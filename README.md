## Abstract

We consider the task of estimating variational autoencoders (VAEs) when the training data is incomplete. We show that missing data increases the complexity of the modelâ€™s posterior distribution over the latent variables compared to the fully-observed case. The increased complexity may adversely affect the fit of the model due to a mismatch between the variational and model posterior distributions. We introduce two strategies based on (i) finite variational-mixture and (ii) imputation-based variational-mixture distributions to address the increased posterior complexity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approaches, we show that variational mixtures are effective at improving the accuracy of VAE estimation from incomplete data.

## Dependencies

Install python dependencies from conda and the `vgiwae` project package with

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate vgiwae
python setup.py develop
```

If the dependencies in `environment.yml` change, update dependencies with

```bash
conda env update --file environment.yml
```

## Organisation of the code

* `./vgiwae/data/` contains data loaders and missingness generators.
* `./vgiwae/models/` contains the model implementations.
  * `mvbvae.py` contains the implementations of the DeMissVAE method in the paper.
  * `vae.py` and `iwae.py` contains the implementations of MVAE, MIWAE, MissVAE, and MissIWAE
  * `multiple_vae.py` and `multiple_iwae.py` contains the implementaions of MissSVAE and MissSIWAE.
* `./configs/` contains the yaml configuration files containing all the information about each experiment.
* `./notebooks/` contain analysis notebooks that produce the figures in the paper.

## Running the code

Activate the conda environment

```bash
conda activate vgiwae
```

### VAE training

To train the VAE, which we use for sampling run e.g.

```bash
python train.py --config=configs/uci_gas/mis50/iwae_i5_encm_stl.yaml
```

### VAE marginal log-likelihood estimation

Use `refit_encoder_using_iwae_and_estimate_loglik.py` to estimate the marginal log-likelihood

```bash
python refit_encoder_using_iwae_and_estimate_loglik.py --config=configs/uci_gas/refit_encoder_testcomp/mis50/iwae_i5_encm_stl.yaml
```
